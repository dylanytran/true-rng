1. Distribution Test (Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test)
The Chi-square goodness-of-fit test compares the observed distribution of your generated numbers to the expected uniform distribution. The test produces two key values: the Chi-square statistic and the p-value.

Chi-square statistic (χ²): Measures the discrepancy between the observed and expected frequencies. A lower value indicates a better fit to the expected distribution.

p-value: Indicates the probability of observing the data assuming the null hypothesis (that the data follows a uniform distribution) is true. Common significance levels are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).

Interpretation:
High p-value (greater than 0.05): Fails to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the random numbers are uniformly distributed.
Low p-value (less than 0.05): Rejects the null hypothesis, indicating that the random numbers do not follow a uniform distribution.

2. Poker Test
The poker test categorizes the generated numbers into different hand types based on the frequency of digits. The results show the counts of various hand types.

Hand Types:
All Different: All digits are unique.
One Pair: Two digits are the same, the rest are different.
Two Pairs: Two sets of two digits are the same, the rest is different.
Three of a Kind: Three digits are the same, the rest are different.
Full House: Three digits are the same, and the remaining two are the same.
Four of a Kind: Four digits are the same, one is different.
Five of a Kind: All five digits are the same.

Interpretation:
Compare the observed counts of each hand type to the expected counts in a truly random sequence. The expected counts can be derived from probability theory for each hand type in a uniformly random sample.

        Interpretation:
            All Different:
            Observed: 35
            Expected: 30.24
            The observed count is slightly higher than the expected count but within a reasonable range.

            One Pair:
            Observed: 48
            Expected: 50.40
            The observed count is slightly lower than the expected count but within a reasonable range.

            Two Pairs:
            Observed: 9
            Expected: 10.80
            The observed count is slightly lower than the expected count but within a reasonable range.

            Three of a Kind:
            Observed: 7
            Expected: 7.20
            The observed count matches the expected count very closely.

            Full House:
            Observed: 1
            Expected: 0.90
            The observed count is very close to the expected count.

            Four of a Kind:
            Observed: 0
            Expected: 0.45
            The observed count is zero, slightly below the expected count but not unexpected given the small sample size.

            Five of a Kind:
            Observed: 0
            Expected: 0.01
            The observed count is zero, which is consistent with the expected count.
